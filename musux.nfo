       First comes the explanation about why such a release :
      _________________________________________________________________________

      After  many years the scene was born it appears that some groups want
      to  make  their own rules and be apart from it. By flooding the scene
      with  useless  crap  on a daily basis, those groups are polluting the
      scene. Those  <usual suspects> are not hard to find : Lz0, BLiZZARD,
      DiSTINCT, iNTENSiON, ORiON, FALLEN (yes, we had forgotten them).
      So  let's  *re*-fix this old rules not to release minor under 14 days
      so  we  stand  all  equal  :] There are hundreds of other groups that
      respect the rules why not them also.
      If  they  think  the  enduser  should  absolutely get those rls, they
      should get the following HQs : 

      WORLD HQ   : XOO*.COM
      GERMAN HQ  : Trip*d.de
      FRENCH HQ  : Multima*ia.fr
      SPANISH HQ : Terra.es
      ITALIAN HQ : Space.tin.it
 
      If  you're  not  convinced  of the uselessness of those crap rls read
      this comment from a respectable guy from the scene : 

      "   I'd just like to say something to MU addicts: 
      Please  imagine  that  you have some (let it be freeware) program you
      really  like...  say,  v1.2.3.4. The next day it's v1.2.3.5. The next
      day  it's  v1.2.3.6, and so on, every day or two a new version of the
      program gets released by the author. 

      Now...  would  you *really* bother yourself downloading a new version
      *every*  day?  (Do  you  refuel your car whenever gas level decreases
      from  100% to 99%?) No, because you don't need it *that* often. You'd
      just  check  the  author's  site  from  time  to  time  (each week or
      fortnight  or  even  less  often) to get yourself the latest version.
      This  means  that  you'd  download  new  versions  with  *reasonable*
      intervals.  Then  why  don't you want to release it with *reasonable*
      intervals??? 

      To  my  point of view it's wrong to think that bringing end users the
      very  latest  versions is what the 0-day scene is all about. Come on,
      that's  what  being a news-agency is all about. Making people able to
      get  stuff  they're unable to get, and *when they need it* looks much
      more like the way it should work.     "

      If you want examples they will be listed on our next rls.
